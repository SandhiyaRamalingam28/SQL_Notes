TRANSACTION

		# Transaction is a set of logically related opertaion.
		# It contains group of tasks.
		# A Transaction is an action or series of actions.
		# It is performed by a single user to perform operations for accessing the contents of the data base.
		
Operations of Transsaction:
		# Read
		# Write
		# Commit
		# Rollback
		
Read(x)
		# Read operations is used to read the value of x from the database and stores it in buffer in main memory.
Write(x)
		# Write operation in used to write the value back to the database from the buffer.
		
		Example
		# R(X);
		# X=x-500;
		# W(X);
Commit
		# It is used to save the work done permanently.
Rollback
		# It is used to undo the work done.
		
Transaction Properties: (ACID)
		1.Atomicity
		2.Consistency
		3.Isolation
		4.Durability 
		
1.Atomicity
		# It states that all the operations of transaction take place at once if not,the transaction is aborted .
		# There is no midway--the transaction cannot occur partially.
		# Each transaction is treated as one unit and either run to completion or is not executed at all.
		
		Operations
				# Abort-If the transaction is aborts then all the changes made are not visible.
				# Commit-If a transaction commits then all the changes made are visible.
				
				
2.Consistency

		# It means the data in the data base should be correct before and after transaction.It is called consistency.
		# Referes the correctness of data base.
		
3.Isolation

		# to avoid inconsistency have to use Isolation property.
		# cannot use the data in second transaction is exccuted ,until the first on is completed.
		
4.Durability

		# It refers the data base consistency called durability.
		# The changes may be consitent or inconsistent.

TRANSACTION STATES.
		1.Active state.
		2.Partially Committed.
		3.Committed state.
		4.Failed state.
		5.Aborted state.
		
		
1.Active state
			# First state of transaction.
			# It start to execute.
			# Insertion,Updation,Deletion .
			# if it is failed goes to failed state.
			# if it is correct goes to partially comitted.
			
2.Partially Comitted
			# Executes all the Read and Write operations.
			# changes or made in main memory or local buffer.
			# If the changes are in permanent in database  then it goes to Comitted state.
			# In case of failure it will go to failure state.
			
			
3.Comitted state
			# all the changes stored in permanantly in data base ,then the transaction goes to the Comitted state.
			
			
4.Failed state.
			# The error occurs while transaction instruction failed or While storing the database permanently failed,then it goes to failed state.
5.Aborted state

			# failed state transaction goes to Aborted state.
			# In this state, the changes made while transaction process in local buffer,all will be roll back.
			# so data will be consistent.
